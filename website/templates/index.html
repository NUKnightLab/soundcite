  <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <p>Audio is a powerful device that can add emotion or context to a story. Unfortunately audio clips force uncomfortable choices: read or listen, but not both. Until now. SoundCite is a simple-to-use tool that lets you add inline audio to your story. The audio is not isolated; it plays right under the text <span class="soundcite" data-id="55521179" data-start="5992" data-end="6651">you choose</span>.</p>
